4. **Highest Salary Expenditure**: Analyzed which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**: Investigated any correlation between age and salary.

## Graphical Representations
- **Team Distribution**: Pie chart to show the percentage of employees in each team.
- **Position Count**: Bar chart for the number of employees in each position.
- **Age Distribution**: Histogram to display the age distribution.
- **Salary vs Position/Team**: Bar charts and scatter plots for salary analysis.
- **Age vs Salary**: Scatter plot for the relationship between age and salary.

## Insights and Trends
- Teams with the highest and lowest representation were identified.
- Salary trends were explored, revealing key patterns in compensation based on position and team.
- A slight negative correlation between age and salary was observed.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization techniques. It provides valuable insights into employee demographics and salary distribution.
